    "# text = \"\"\"Thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity, and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelleys Frankenstein or Karel Capeks R.U.R. (Rossums Universal Robots). These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence. The study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turings theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the Church-Turing thesis. Along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain. Turing proposed that if a human could not distinguish between responses from a machine and a human, the machine could be considered intelligent. The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts 1943 formal design for Turing-complete artificial neurons. The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. Attendees Allen Newell (CMU), Herbert Simon (CMU), John McCarthy (MIT), Marvin Minsky (MIT) and Arthur Samuel (IBM) became the founders and leaders of AI research. They and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing: computers were learning checkers strategies (c. 1954) (and by 1959 were reportedly playing better than the average human),[32] solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems (Logic Theorist, first ru
